It's a Goss Off!!!
Which Ryan will get to eat the cereal?

Choose one of the Ryan Gosling characters:


Alan Bosley - Remember the Titans
Noah - The Notebook
Driver - Drive
Jacob - Crazy, Stupid, Love
Lars - Lars and the Real Girl


Alan {
    Health: 210
    Attack: 5
    Counter-Attack: 12
}

Noah {
    Health: 160
    Attack: 7
    Counter-Attack: 20
}

Driver {
    Health: 120
    Attack: 9
    Counter-Attack: 22
}

Jacob {

    Attack: 8
    Counter-Attack: 18
}

Lars {
    Health: 180
    Attack: 6
    Counter-Attack: 17
}


Once selected, you pick who to attack


Use jQuery to loop through and create the characters





//5 character objects
//var playerCharacter
//var dead = false;


// if (player.health >= 0) {
    player.dead = true;
}
