A card-combat game that would be a licensing nightmare!

## Game notes:
(Based of the obscure Vines of Ryan Gosling refusing to eat his cereal.)

Well, Ryan's finally hungry! Battle other Ryan's for a bowl of Crispex...the El Camino of cereals.

Basic Gameplay:
First click on who you want as your character. 
Next select who your first opponent is. Watchout! One of these Ryan's has a mean right hook.
Click attack until Ryan (you) or Ryan (not-you) is dead.
Beat all Not-You-Ryan's to win.
